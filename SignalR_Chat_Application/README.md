"SignalR - The Complete Guide (with real world examples)"


SignalR is a library for ASP.NET developers that makes it painless to add real-time web functionality to your applications. SignalR augments the traditional request-response model of HTTP with the concept of connection. It allows you to set up a persistent connection between the server and the browser. SignalR also enables a rich two-way communication channel, which is actually an improvement over traditional API calls.
